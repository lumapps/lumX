The first responsive front-end framework based on [AngularJS][angular] & [Google Material Design specifications][material]. *lumX* will help you to design your applications faster and easier. We followed Google Material Design recommendations to bring the best experience to your users.

## Quick start

Three quick start options are available:

- [Download the latest release][release].
- Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/lumapps/lumx.git.
- Install with Bower: `bower install lumx`.

## Documentation

lumX's documentation, included in this repo in the demo directory, is built with [Gulp][gulp] and hosted on [Google App Engine][gae] at http://ui.lumapps.com. The docs may also be run locally.

### Running documentation locally

1. If necessary, install the [Python SDK of Google App Engine][gaepython].
2. In your environment, declare the variable `APPENGINE` with the path to your Google App Engine binaries.
For example, using bash in a Unix system with the default path will need to edit the `.bashrc` in your home to add:
    ```bash
    export APPENGINE=/home/USER/google-cloud-sdk/bin/
    ```
3. Run `npm install & bower install`.
4. Run `./launch.sh`.
5. Visit [http://localhost:8888][local] in your browser, and voilà.
